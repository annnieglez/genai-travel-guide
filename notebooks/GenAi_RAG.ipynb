    "### Query Processing and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a workflow where user queries are processed and answered using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. The workflow involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Embedding**:\n",
    "    - The user provides a query.\n",
    "    - The query is embedded using the OpenAI API with the embedding model (`text-embedding-3-large`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relevant Chunk Retrieval**:\n",
    "    - The embedded query is used to retrieve relevant chunks from the `chramdb` database.\n",
    "    - These chunks are selected based on their relevance to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Answer Generation**:\n",
    "    - The retrieved chunks are passed to the OpenAI API using the GPT-4 model (`gpt-4o`).\n",
    "        - The model generates an answer based solely on the information retrieved from the database.\n",
    "        - Queries will be saved in a pickle file `..\\chroma_db\\query_embeddings_cached` to reduce the number of calls and speed up response time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **LLM as a Judge**:\n",
    "    - The LLM model is used to evaluate the generated answers, providing a score and an explanation for the evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Examples of queries**:\n",
    "    - Results from some test queries are provided for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook ensures that answers are grounded in the retrieved data, providing accurate and contextually relevant responses. Make sure to configure your OpenAI API key by running in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo OPENAI_API_KEY=\"\" > .env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Change `\"\"` with your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the notebook functions as intended, `genai_scripts` modules (`GenAI_RAG` ) need to be installed by running `..\\setup.py` (more in the `README.md`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**üö® Check the `README.me` before continuing with this notebook**\n"

It offers stunning views of the Atlantic Ocean, downtown Reykjavik, Sn√¶fellsj√∂kull glacier, and even a volcano. The lagoon is designed with Icelandic elements such as turf and lava rocks, and it features a unique 7-step Icelandic bathing ritual for relaxation. This ritual includes experiences such as indulging in the lagoon, a cold plunge, a sauna session, a cold mist, a body scrub, a steam room visit, and a refreshing shower to complete the process.\n",

      "Various package options are available, each offering different prices. For example, the Pure package is priced at 11,500 Icelandic Krona.

The spa offers facilities such as saunas, steam rooms, a lagoon waterfall, and a viewing deck. It also has a store that sells silica-based skincare products, the Retreat Spa for a luxury experience, and dining options ranging from cafes to gourmet restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "The water temperature generally ranges between 37¬∞C and 40¬∞C (98-104¬∞F), and the lagoon is a self-cleaning ecosystem, meaning disinfectants like chlorine are not needed. The Blue Lagoon is accessible to guests with special needs and requires advance booking as it tends to get fully booked weeks in advance.\n",
